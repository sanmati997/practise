Git Session Notes

Day 1


  What is Git?

    VCS : Version Control System  : Its a s/w designed to record changes made to file/files over a
                                   time period

   Day 2 : 24th March 2021
   git init   

   git add .
   git add hello.txt
   git add *.js
   git add a.*
   

 git commit -m InitalCommit


Rules for commit messages
  1. The message should be elobarate so that we can see the reason why that commit was made
  2. Commit messages are always written in presentence
 git commit -m  "Add table tag in index.html" 


 git status 

files with extension .md is aMarkDown syntax file


   Git diff (diff == difference)
  1. what changes have we staged that are ready to be committed?  git diff --staged
  2. What changes we have made but not staged yet
    

diff --git a/site.css b/site.css    === compared files

index 576c52d..20dcf9a 100644   == file metadata SHA1 code and 100644 represents a normal file
--- a/site.css
+++b/site.css   === Change markers for File a/b

@@ -1,3 +1,6 @@    == Chunk Header
 

Intro to Git Branch

A branch in git is just a lightweight moveable pointer to a commit made in a project.


 git branch test   (a branch gets created but  we are still in the master branch)

 git checkout test (with this command we switch to the test branch



  git checkout -b Branch1  (this command creates a new branch and also switches to that branch )

  Fast forward merge : When no activity is done in the master after you branched out to a newBranch
                       and you continue to work only with NewBranch before merging
  Recurssive Merge : When you keep switching between branches and committing before merging then
                     the merge is called a recurssive startegy merge

Merge Conflict : [Pending]

    REBASING  and Cherry Picking

  Rebasing is to clean up the local history so that we can just focus on end result.
   Rebase is an advanced feature of Git

  Clean up the history of commits
  pull  changes without merge

  git rebase <branch-name>


   git log --online
   

    git merge-base solution master  // Gets the original base of the solution branch created from 
                                    // master
    git rebase -i <commit-id>


     Commands for Cherry picking
       git log --oneline   : find the commit you want to cherry pick
       git log <branch-name> --oneline 


     git checkout <branch-name>   : where do you want to put the commit? checkout to that branch
      

      git cherry-pick <commit sha1>   This will perform the cherry-pick to append
                                       the commit to HEAD

git branch -d <branchname>
git branch -D <branch name> to force delete of uncommitted branch

//you can delete a branch only if you are not in that branch which you want to delete

rename
 git branch -m <branch name> //To rename the branch name

  Centralized or remote repo, pull push diff
  Avoid conflicts
      .gitignore file
  

pull requests 
How to resolve difficult merge conflicts
       
    
 Remote repo is just a location where the project is hosted
  GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, 

Reference Project

git clone <remote-url>   : pull the code and set up a local branch

origin :     Default name for remote server

 git remote add <name> <remote-url>  : giving name to the remote repo

 git pull  === (fetch and merge)

git remote -v   : list the remotes and urls

 git push : push local repo to the remote

Ignore files
 .gitignore
  #this is a commet in .gitignore file
   **/bin
  *.zip
  /node_modules




Team Conventions

   have a comman .gitignore file
   README.md
   Frequent smaller commits is preferred vs.  one giant commit



  Pull Request :

 . push branch to remote this will open a pull request
 . once you open a pull request we can add reviewers and discuss the changes with the team
 .  Once the reviewers ask you to make changes in the branch , make  the fix of code in local
    branch and push to the remote
. We do not rebase after pushing to the remote repo
 . once the pull request is approved we can merge the branch with the master/main and delete the branch
